# CRITICAL: We want to include the results folder for deployment.
# Therefore, ensure the 'results/' line and related patterns are commented out.
# Any specific file/folder that is explicitly NOT ignored (e.g., !requirements.txt)
# will take precedence over general ignore patterns (e.g., *.pth).

# IGNORE these general file types by default, BUT specific files/folders below will override
# *.csv
# *.log
# *.json
# *.txt
# *.pth
# *.pt
# *.mp4
# *.pkl
# *.bin
# *.model

# EXPLICITLY UN-IGNORE THESE (CRUCIAL for deployment)
!requirements.txt        # Always commit your dependencies list

# IMPORTANT: To make 'results/' work, we must explicitly allow it.
# The default 'results/' line would have ignored it.
!results/                # <--- CRITICAL: Explicitly allow the results/ folder
!results/*               # <--- CRITICAL: Allow all contents within results/
